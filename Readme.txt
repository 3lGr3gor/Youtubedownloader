You must have python installed on your pc.
Before you start you need to open command prompt and install :

pip install os
pip install tkinter
pip install pytube
pip install moviepy

When you start the program just paste the youtube url and select the library where you want to save your mp3 file. Then click download and convert. 

The program downloads the youtube video, converts it and deletes the original video, only the mp3 file will remain.
